# NoFlake - YouTube Commitment Buffer

## Overview
NoFlake is a Chrome extension that adds a customizable buffer time to YouTube videos, preventing users from pausing for a specified period after starting playback. This extension helps viewers commit to watching content without constantly stopping and starting videos.

**Built by suggestion for the H3 Podcast by Dan & Ethan!**

## Features
- **Customizable Buffer Time**: Set how long (in seconds) a viewer must watch before being allowed to pause
- **Visual Notifications**: On-screen messages show buffer status and remaining time
- **Ad Handling**: Option to exclude ad time from buffer calculations
