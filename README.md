# NoFlake - YouTube Commitment Buffer

## Overview
NoFlake is a Chrome extension that adds a customizable buffer time to YouTube videos, preventing users from pausing for a specified period after starting playback. This extension helps viewers commit to watching content without constantly stopping and starting videos.

**Built by suggestion for the H3 Podcast by Dan & Ethan!**
**Originally suggested during H3TV #91 at [2:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/live/WZbGjnOT9Mc?si=JlHkEky9G5mFbpMQ&t=9372)**

## Features
- **Customizable Buffer Time**: Set how long (in seconds) a viewer must watch before being allowed to pause
- **Visual Notifications**: On-screen messages show buffer status and remaining time
- **Customizable Messages**: Personalize the notification text for when pause is locked and enabled
- **Ad Handling**: Option to exclude ad time from buffer calculations
- **Video Length Filtering**: Option to only apply the buffer to videos longer than 5 minutes
- **Auto-Enable**: Automatically enable the buffer on all YouTube videos or control manually

## Installation
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory
5. The NoFlake icon should appear in your Chrome toolbar

## Developer Instructions

### Testing Changes
When making continuous edits to the extension during development:

1. Make your code changes (editing HTML, JS, or CSS files)
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Find the NoFlake extension and click the refresh icon (â†»)
4. No need to uninstall and reinstall - the refresh updates the extension with your changes

If the refresh icon doesn't appear to apply your changes:
- Check if you modified the manifest.json file (requires a full reload)
- Make sure you saved all your edited files
- Try opening a new YouTube page to see the changes

### Debugging
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/` and click on "background page" under NoFlake to access the DevTools for the background script
2. On YouTube pages, right-click and select "Inspect" then navigate to the "Console" tab to see extension logs
3. Add `console.log()` statements to debug specific code paths

### Common Issues
- **Changes not appearing**: Make sure to refresh the extension and reload YouTube pages
- **Storage not updating**: Check the Chrome DevTools console for errors during storage operations
- **Content script not running**: Verify the manifest.json content_scripts section includes the correct URL patterns
- **Permissions issues**: Make sure all required permissions are properly listed in manifest.json

## Usage
1. Click the NoFlake icon in your Chrome toolbar to open the settings popup
2. Set your desired buffer time (in seconds)

   - Toggle notifications on/off

   - Adjust notification color and opacity
   - Enable/disable auto-activation

## For Content Creators
NoFlake is perfect for podcast creators, educators, and other content creators who want their audience to engage more deeply with their content. Some potential use cases:

3. **Custom Notification Styles**: Allow users to customize the appearance of notifications
4. **Scheduled Buffer Times**: Different buffer settings based on time of day
5. **Keyboard Shortcut Override**: Prevent keyboard shortcuts from pausing during buffer
